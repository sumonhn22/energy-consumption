### Activatate the virtual environment

After installing anaconda into your system follow the steps bellow to work in a virtual environment.

Creation of the VE:
```
conda create python=3.7 --name deep-ts
```

Activating the VE:
```
conda activate deep-ts
```

Installing all the packages from the **requirements.txt** file to the virtual environment:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio code there may be some additional pop ups indiciating that some packages should be installed (linter or ikernel).
